Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLCLJ is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slclj.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp and swank-*.lisp)

  For a real description, see the manual in doc/

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

  Add this to your ~/.emacs file and fill in the appropriate filenames:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/hacking/lisp/slclj/")  ; your SLCLJ directory
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") ; your Lisp system
    (require 'slclj)
    (slclj-setup)

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp.

  Use `M-x' slclj to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.
  SLCLJ will now automatically be available in your Lisp source
  buffers.

SLCLJ is a fork of SLIME from August 4, 2010, which worked with
Clojure, where every instance of the term slime has been replaced with
SLCLJ to enable the two to exist in your emacs setup simultaneously
and without fear of further SLIME development breaking functionality
with Clojure.  Follow the directions at
https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure to set up a swank server
for Clojure, set up emacs to work with SLCLJ much like how you would
for SLIME, and then connect using

M-x slclj-connect

Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLCLJ is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slclj.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp and swank-*.lisp)

  For a real description, see the manual in doc/

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

  Add this to your ~/.emacs file and fill in the appropriate filenames:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/hacking/lisp/slclj/")  ; your SLCLJ directory
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") ; your Lisp system
    (require 'slclj)
    (slclj-setup)

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp.

  Use `M-x' slclj to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.
  SLCLJ will now automatically be available in your Lisp source
  buffers.
